# A.T.A.I.S
### Automated Technological Artificial Intelligent System

## INTRODUCTION
A.T.A.I.S is a personal assistant powered by Codex, the new AI system created by Open AI that helps developers write, organize and structure their codes.
It answers almost everything starting from coding questions, explains the code, generates documentation, and calculates the time complexity of functions, teaching resources and many more!
Basically helps developers read, write, and understand code. It is a smart coding assistant that helps software engineers build software better and faster.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Development is the collective process of some computer science activities dedicated to the process of developing software applications.
Which quite at times gets buzzing for developers to understand the code, find the most optimized solution and to keep it clean and that too all by themselves.
